## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 9 reverse dependencies. Summary at <https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/blob/master/revdep/README.md>. No problems were found related to this package. MazamaSpatialUtils package errors on check, but errors with both current CRAN version of this package and the version being submitted.

-------

This version swaps out two package dependencies for other packages.

Thanks!
