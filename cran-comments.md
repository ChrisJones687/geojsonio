## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 8 downstream dependencies.
  (Summary at <https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/blob/master/revdep/README.md>).
  One package errored on check but the errors are unrelated to this package.

-------

Major change in this version is some new functions - also some minor
improvements - and a bug fix.

Thanks!
