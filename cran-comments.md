## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 10 reverse dependencies. Summary at <https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/blob/master/revdep/README.md>. No problems were found related to this package.

-------

This version swaps out two package dependencies for other packages, and adds params to a few functions.

Thanks!
