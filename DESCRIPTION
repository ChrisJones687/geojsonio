Package: geojsonio
Title: Convert Data from and to geoJSON or topoJSON
Description: Convert data to geoJSON or topoJSON from various R classes,
    including vectors, lists, data frames, shape files, and more. This
    package does not aim to replace packages like sp, rgdal, rgeos, but
    rather aims to be a high level client to simplify conversions of data
    from and to geoJSON and topoJSON.
